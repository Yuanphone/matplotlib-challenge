## Background
Pymaceuticals Inc., a new pharmaceutical company specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. We are going to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. Our task is to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study and a summary of the study results.
## Observations and Insights
Based on the analysis of the two datasets provided, there are 249 mice assigned to 10 drugs' treatments. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

In the bar charts, the bar plots show the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen. The Capomulin has the most time point, and the Propriva has the least time point.

In the pie charts, the pie plots show the distribution of female and male mice. The female mice have 49.8% and the male mice have 50.2%. The male mice have one more than female mice (125 vs. 124).

In the part of quartiles, outliers and boxplots, the tumor volume for four drug regimens were analyzed. The result is that only one drug Infubinol has 1 outlier, and the number is 36.3213458.

In the line plot, the tumor volume and the time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin was negatively correlated. The time point increases and the tumor volume decreases. 5.In the scatter plot, the average tumor volume is positively correlated with mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen. The mouse weight increases and the average tumor volume increases.

The correlation coefficient is 0.88, which means there is a relatively strong positive relationship between the mouse weight and the average tumor volume. The r-squared for linear regression model is 0.70 which indicates that the model explains 70% of the variability of the response data around its mean. The average tumor volume could be predictable by using average weight of mouse.
